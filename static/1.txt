<p>&#8220;I am taking time to write this to enlighten folks who are or have never experienced a bed bug infestation.
	<strong>There is no way that I can make this a real short story</strong> but I think you might be interested in
	something that you think could never happen to you.
</p>
<h3>I never in my wildest dreams did I ever expect to have it happen to me.</h3>
<p>I always lived in a very clean home in suburbia always in an upscale neighborhood. <a

<p>I had put some things in storage and after a year I decided it was ridiculous to keep spending $100.00 a month on
	stuff that I would probably never use again. So, I brought the stuff into my home with the idea of giving most of
	the things to charity. I left the stuff sit for about a week and began getting rid of most of these belongings.</p>
<p><strong>Well, a few weeks later I noticed two very unfamiliar bugs on my ankle at about <span tabindex="0"
			data-term="goog_2044064696">8 am</span>.</strong></p>
<p>After confirming that these were bed bugs, I just flipped out. The first mistake I made was to call an extermination
	company who touted &#8220;bed bug control&#8221; not extermination, but at the time I didn&#8217;t care. I wanted
	these things out of my home. I unfortunately signed some papers and after all was said and done I was out $4000.00
	and I still had bed bugs.</p>
<p>Naturally I called and cursed them out and it seemed whatever I said fell on deaf ears. Next, I went to Home Depot
	and bought every product that even intoned that their product destroyed bed bugs. I sprayed my entire home. By now
	I&#8217;m getting educated that there is more to this process than just using pesticides or &#8220;bombs&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is extremely important that you vaccum your entire home on a daily basis and do lots of laundry on the hottest
	cycles available to you.</p>
<p><strong>I did not begin to see any real positive results until after <a
			style="color: #00f; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide" target="_blank">I
			went online and discovered SayByeBugs.</a></strong> I made my first order of two 24 oz. bottles of non toxic
	bed bug spray, which appealed to me in itself. I began spraying behind every picture and yes I saw a few behind a
	few pictures.</p>
<p>Underneath antiques and actually all my furniture. Just think that just a few of them can turn into hundreds in a
	very short time so I cannot emphasize enough that you have to be diligent. I live in South Florida where we have all
	types of creepy things but I grew up with them and none ever bothered me like these resilient bed bugs.</p>
<p>There are luxury hotels, cruise ships, and yes storage units and on and on where infestations have occurred.
	It&#8217;s usually a hush hush matter with respect to a business as you can well imagine why. Nobody is immune from
	the possibility of this happening to them.</p>
<h3><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide" target="_blank">Personally, it was
		overwhelming for me until I found SayByeBugs</a>.</h3>
<p>Gradually with the spray and laundry products they have developed I began to see positive results. It actually took
	me about a month to finally get a decent nights sleep. These bugs are nocturnal so their sleeping lives are the
	antithesis of ours.</p>
<p>No human can sustain sleep deprivation for a prolonged period of time but that&#8217;s what happens because they are
	constantly on your mind after <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2044064697">midnight</span> until the sun rises.
</p>
<p>The ones I had must have been especially aggressive because there wasn&#8217;t a hour of the day I couldn&#8217;t find one at
	the onset. Truth be told the CIA uses sleep deprivation as a form of torture. And when it becomes self inflicted you
	must act.</p>
<p>If it were not for <a style="color: #00f; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide"
		target="_blank">Say Bye Bugs</a> I just don&#8217;t know what I would have done other than trying to sell my
	home and move into a brand new one, which just wasn&#8217;t a realistic remedy.</p>
<p>So, if you have or even travel be exposed get Say Bye Bugs and spray everything. I&#8217;m talking about baggage and
	other types of luggage you have used after a trip. Spray your luggage outside before bringing it into your home. I
	know you probably think that I am a bed bug paranoia freak.</p>
<p>Well, truth be told after what I experienced I am and you would be as well. Do yourself a favor, even if you think it
	cannot happen to you have a couple spray bottles at the ready.</p>
<h3><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide" target="_blank">Time is of the essence
		when it comes to exterminating these pests</a>.</h3>
<p>I cannot thank SayByeBugs enough that they had an inexpensive way do deal with this problem. I am not being
	compensated for this to long of a letter but I just would hate to see anyone have to go through what I did. At any
	rate, I hope I was able to shed some light on a growing problem that none of us are exempt from.</p>
<p>Everyone should have at least a bottle of Say Bye Bugs which hopefully you will never have to use.</p>
<p>Do yourself a simple favor and pick up the phone and call <a style="color: #00f; text-decoration: underline;"
		href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide" target="_blank">SayByeBugs (855 290-8300)</a> or simply email them at
	<a style="color: #00f; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.saybyebugs.com?AFFID=guide"
		target="_blank">support@saybyebugs.com</a>, they are very accommodating as they know what you are going through.
	I just cannot say enough about a product that returned my life to normalcy and I&#8217;m very thankful for that.
</p>
<p>I wish you all the best of luck in life and prosper and most importantly be happy. Thank you for taking the time to
	read my unfortunate encounter with the damn bed bugs.&#8221;<br />
